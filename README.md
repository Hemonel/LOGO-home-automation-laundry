This is my university final project.

It's a home automation laundry make in LOGO Siemens. It can turn washers, dryers, and lights on and off; it can open and close the portal, and it also has an automatic opening system.

The interface to control the entire system is designed through the LOGO Web Editor, so that the system is accessed through a browser.
